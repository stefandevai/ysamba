# Colonization of Ysamba

The year is 1541 and while the Spanish colonization is already underway in the American continent, some caravels have been seen for the first time in the region of Ysamba.

Colonization of Ysamba is a society simulation game where you try to survive as a Native American family in an procedurally generated island that is being colonized by Spanish conquistadores. Will you hide in the mountains and live as hunter-gatherers? Will you forge alliances with other native groups to attack the colonizers? Will you integrate with the Spanish colony and help them find gold?
